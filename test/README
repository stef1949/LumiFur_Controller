This directory is intended for PlatformIO Test Runner and project tests.

Unit Testing is a software testing method by which individual units of
source code, sets of one or more MCU program modules together with associated
control data, usage procedures, and operating procedures, are tested to
determine whether they are fit for use. Unit testing finds problems early
in the development cycle.

## Quick Start

### Run all tests:
```bash
# Using PlatformIO (recommended)
pio test -e native2

# Using standalone script (if PlatformIO has issues)
./test/run_unity_tests.sh
```

### Run specific test:
```bash
pio test -e native2 -f test_animation_state
```

## Test Suites

The LumiFur Controller project includes comprehensive Unity framework tests:

- **test_animation_state** - AnimationState module tests (7 tests)
- **test_scroll_state** - ScrollState module tests (6 tests)
- **test_easing_functions** - Easing functions tests (7 tests)
- **test_ble** - BLE module tests (13 tests)
- **test_main** - Main application tests
- **test_timers** - Timer threshold tests
- **test_bitmaps** - Bitmap validation tests
- **color_parser** - Color parsing tests (GoogleTest)

**Total: 33+ tests** ensuring code quality and correctness.
