   - Hardware setup (ESP32 board, LED matrix configuration)
   - Software environment (PlatformIO version, library versions)
   - Screenshots or videos if applicable

## üí° Requesting Features

Have an idea for a new feature or enhancement? We'd love to hear about it!

1. **Search existing issues** to see if the feature has already been requested
2. **Create a new issue** using our [Feature Request template](https://github.com/stef1949/LumiFur_Controller/issues/new?assignees=&labels=enhancement&template=feature_request.md&title=%5BFEATURE%5D)
3. **Describe your idea** including:
   - What problem the feature would solve
   - How you envision it working
   - Any additional context or examples

## üîß Contributing Code

Ready to contribute code? Awesome! Here's how to get started:

### 1. Fork the Repository

1. Navigate to the [LumiFur_Controller repository](https://github.com/stef1949/LumiFur_Controller)
2. Click the "Fork" button in the top-right corner
3. This creates your own copy of the repository under your GitHub account

### 2. Clone Your Fork

```bash
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/LumiFur_Controller.git
cd LumiFur_Controller
```

### 3. Set Up Development Environment

Ensure you have the required tools installed:

- **PlatformIO** (with VSCode extension recommended)
- **Git**
- **GitHub Copilot** (recommended for enhanced development experience)

The project will automatically handle library dependencies defined in `platformio.ini`.

#### GitHub Copilot Integration ü§ñ

This project includes comprehensive GitHub Copilot instructions to help you develop more efficiently:

- **Review Instructions**: Check `.github/copilot-instructions.md` for detailed project context
- **Usage Guide**: See `docs/COPILOT_USAGE.md` for development workflow tips
- **Chat Instructions**: Use `.github/copilot-chat-instructions.md` for focused assistance

Copilot understands our embedded C++ patterns, ESP32 constraints, and PlatformIO build system, making it an excellent tool for both new contributors and experienced developers.

### 4. Create a Descriptive Branch

Create a new branch for your changes with a descriptive name:

```bash
# For bug fixes
git checkout -b fix/issue-description

# For new features  
git checkout -b feature/feature-description

# For documentation updates
git checkout -b docs/update-description

# Examples:
git checkout -b fix/bluetooth-connection-timeout
git checkout -b feature/new-facial-expression
git checkout -b docs/update-installation-guide
```

### 5. Run the Test Suite

Before making changes, ensure all tests pass:

```bash
# Run unit tests for native environment
pio test -e native

# Run tests with coverage
pio test -e native2

# For hardware-specific tests (if available)
pio test -e adafruit_matrixportal_esp32s3
```

If you encounter test failures not related to your changes, please report them as separate issues.

### 6. Implement Your Changes

- **Write clean, readable code** that follows the existing code style
- **Add comments** where necessary to explain complex logic
- **Test your changes thoroughly** on actual hardware when possible
- **Update documentation** if your changes affect user-facing functionality
- **Add or update tests** to cover your new code

#### Code Style Guidelines

- Follow existing naming conventions
- Use consistent indentation (spaces vs tabs as per existing files)
- Keep functions focused and reasonably sized
- Add meaningful comments for complex hardware interactions

### 7. Test Your Changes

Before submitting your pull request:

```bash
# Build for your target environment
pio run -e adafruit_matrixportal_esp32s3

# Run tests
pio test

# Test on actual hardware if possible
pio run -e adafruit_matrixportal_esp32s3 -t upload
```

### 8. Commit Your Changes

Write clear, descriptive commit messages:

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Fix: Resolve Bluetooth connection timeout issue

- Increase connection timeout from 5s to 15s
- Add retry logic for failed connections
- Update error messaging for connection failures

Fixes #123"
```

### 9. Keep Your Branch Updated

Before submitting your pull request, make sure your branch is up to date:

```bash
# Add the original repository as upstream
git remote add upstream https://github.com/stef1949/LumiFur_Controller.git

# Fetch latest changes
git fetch upstream

# Rebase your branch onto the latest main
git rebase upstream/main
```

If there are conflicts, resolve them and continue the rebase:

```bash
git add .
git rebase --continue
```

### 10. Submit a Pull Request

1. **Push your branch** to your fork:
   ```bash
   git push origin your-branch-name
   ```

2. **Create a pull request** from your fork to the main repository:
   - Go to your fork on GitHub
   - Click "New Pull Request"
   - Select your branch and the main repository's `main` branch
   - Fill out the pull request template with:
     - Clear description of changes
     - Link to related issues
     - Testing performed
     - Screenshots/videos for UI changes

3. **Respond to feedback** and make requested changes if needed

### 11. Keep Your Pull Request Updated

If the main branch receives updates while your PR is open:

```bash
# Fetch and rebase onto latest main
git fetch upstream
git rebase upstream/main

# Force push to update your PR (safe for PRs)
git push --force-with-lease origin your-branch-name
```

## üß™ Testing

This project uses multiple testing frameworks:

- **Unity** for embedded unit testing
- **GoogleTest** for native testing
- **Coverage** analysis for code quality

When adding new features:
- Write unit tests for core functionality
- Test on actual hardware when possible
- Include edge case testing

## üìã Pull Request Guidelines

- **One feature per PR** - keep changes focused and atomic
- **Update documentation** for user-facing changes
- **Add tests** for new functionality
- **Follow the existing code style**
- **Write descriptive commit messages**
- **Reference related issues** using keywords like "Fixes #123"

## üìû Getting Help

Need help or have questions?

- **Check existing issues** and discussions
- **Create a new issue** with the "question" label
- **Join community discussions** in the project's issue tracker

## üìú Code of Conduct
