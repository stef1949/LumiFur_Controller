# Using GitHub Copilot with LumiFur Controller

This guide helps you effectively use GitHub Copilot when contributing to the LumiFur Controller project.

## Quick Start

1. **Install Copilot Extensions**: Ensure you have the recommended VS Code extensions installed
2. **Review Project Instructions**: Check `.github/copilot-instructions.md` for comprehensive guidance
3. **Use Chat Mode**: Reference `.github/copilot-chat-instructions.md` for focused assistance

## Copilot-Aware Development Workflow

### Setting Up Your Environment

When you start working on LumiFur Controller, GitHub Copilot will automatically:
- Understand the embedded C++ context
- Recognize ESP32 hardware constraints  
- Apply appropriate memory management patterns
- Suggest PlatformIO-compatible code structures

### Common Copilot Use Cases

#### 1. Adding New Facial Expressions
```cpp
// Copilot understands the bitmap pattern and view management
void addNewExpression() {
    // Type: "Create new facial expression bitmap for..."
    // Copilot will suggest PROGMEM bitmap arrays and view handling
}
```

#### 2. BLE Command Handling
```cpp
// Copilot knows the single-byte command pattern
void handleNewBLECommand(uint8_t command) {
    // Type: "Handle BLE command for..."  
    // Copilot suggests appropriate command validation and response
}
```

#### 3. Animation Functions
```cpp
// Copilot understands easing functions and frame management
void createSmoothTransition() {
    // Type: "Create smooth animation from view A to view B"
    // Copilot suggests frame interpolation and timing logic
}
```

#### 4. Hardware Interaction
```cpp
// Copilot knows ESP32 pin management and sensor patterns
void setupNewSensor() {
    // Type: "Setup I2C sensor with error handling"
    // Copilot suggests proper initialization and error checking
}
```

### Testing with Copilot

Copilot understands our testing framework and can help generate:
- Unity test cases for embedded functions
- GoogleTest suites for complex logic
- Mock hardware interactions for testing
- Performance test patterns

Example prompt: "Generate Unity test for easing function validation"

### Code Review with Copilot

Use Copilot Chat to review your code:
- "Review this BLE handler for memory efficiency"
- "Check this animation code for performance issues"  
- "Suggest improvements for this matrix update function"

### Best Practices for Copilot Prompts

#### Effective Prompts
- ✅ "Create ESP32-compatible deep sleep function with wake on GPIO"
- ✅ "Generate HUB75 matrix update with DMA consideration"
- ✅ "Add NimBLE characteristic with proper callback handling"

#### Less Effective Prompts  
- ❌ "Make this code better"
- ❌ "Fix the bug"
- ❌ "Add error handling"

### Project-Specific Context

Copilot is aware of:
- **Memory Constraints**: Will suggest PROGMEM for large data
- **Performance Needs**: Avoids blocking operations in critical paths
- **Hardware Patterns**: Understands DMA, interrupts, and pin management
- **Code Style**: Follows established naming and organization patterns
- **Build System**: Suggests PlatformIO-compatible configurations

### Troubleshooting Copilot Suggestions

If Copilot suggestions don't match the project patterns:

1. **Add Context**: Include more specific details about hardware or constraints
2. **Reference Existing Code**: Point to similar functions in the codebase  
3. **Use Chat Mode**: Explain the specific embedded requirements
4. **Review Instructions**: Check if the copilot-instructions.md covers your use case

### Advanced Copilot Features

#### Documentation Generation
- Generate comments for complex hardware interactions
- Create README sections for new features
- Update contributing guidelines for new patterns

#### Refactoring Assistance
- Suggest memory optimizations
- Propose code organization improvements
- Help migrate to newer library versions

#### Performance Analysis
- Identify potential bottlenecks in animation code
- Suggest optimizations for matrix refresh rates
- Review memory usage patterns

## Integration with Development Process

### Before Coding
1. Review existing similar code with Copilot Chat
2. Ask for architectural suggestions
3. Get guidance on testing approach

### During Development
1. Use Copilot for boilerplate code generation
2. Get suggestions for error handling
3. Generate appropriate debug output

### After Coding
1. Use Copilot Chat for code review
2. Generate test cases
3. Update documentation

### Pull Request Preparation
1. Ask Copilot to review for embedded best practices
2. Generate descriptive commit messages
3. Create comprehensive PR descriptions

This workflow helps you leverage GitHub Copilot's understanding of the LumiFur Controller project while maintaining the high quality and embedded-specific patterns that make the codebase robust and maintainable.
