- Smooth blinking animations
- Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) connectivity to switch expressions remotely
- Boot-up animation with scrolling text
  
## Hardware Requirements üõ†Ô∏è
- ESP32 development board
- 2 x Hub75 64x32 LED matrix displays
- Connecting wires and power supply
  
## Software Requirements üíª
- VSCode with PlatformIO Extension 
- MatrixPanel-DMA library
- FastLED Library
- NimBLE-Arduino library
- Adafruit GFX Library
- Adafruit NeoPixel Library

## Installation ‚öôÔ∏è

1. Clone the repository:
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/stef1949/LumiFur_Controller.git
    ```

2. Install the required libraries in Arduino IDE:

### MD_MAX72XX Library:

- Go to Sketch > Include Library > Manage Libraries...
- Search for MD_MAX72XX and install it.

### NimBLE-Arduino Library:

- Follow the installation instructions here.

3. Open the project:

- Open main.cpp in the Arduino IDE.

4. Configure hardware settings if necessary:

- Check the pin definitions (CLK_PIN, DATA_PIN, CS_PIN) and adjust them to match your setup.

## Usage üìñ

1. Connect your ESP32 to the computer via USB.
2. Select the correct board and port in the Arduino IDE.
3. Click Upload to flash the code.

### Assemble the hardware:

- Connect the LED matrix modules to the ESP32 according to your wiring configuration.

### Operate the Protogen mask:

1. Power on the device.
2. The mask will display the default idle face with animations.
3. Use the LumiFur app to connect to 'LumiFur_Controller'.
4. Send values between 1 and 8 to change facial expressions.

### Facial Expressions üòÉ

- 1 - Idle Face
- 2 - Happy Face
- 3 - Angry Face
- 4 - Playful Face
- 5 - Silly Face
- 6 - Kinky Face
- 7 - Death Face
- 8 - Edgy Face

## GitHub Copilot Integration ü§ñ

This project includes comprehensive GitHub Copilot instructions to help you develop more efficiently. The instructions provide context about:

- **Embedded C++ patterns** specific to ESP32 development
- **Hardware constraints** and memory management guidelines  
- **PlatformIO build system** usage and environment configurations
- **LED matrix and BLE** communication patterns
- **Animation and graphics** optimization techniques
- **Testing frameworks** (Unity and GoogleTest) integration

### Getting Started with Copilot

1. **Install Extensions**: The recommended VS Code extensions include GitHub Copilot
2. **Review Instructions**: Check `.github/copilot-instructions.md` for detailed guidance
3. **Use Chat Instructions**: Use `.github/copilot-chat-instructions.md` for Copilot Chat sessions

### Copilot-Assisted Development Tips

- **Hardware Context**: Copilot understands ESP32 memory constraints and embedded best practices
- **Code Patterns**: Follows established patterns for view management, animations, and BLE communication
- **Testing Support**: Generates appropriate Unity and GoogleTest test cases
- **Documentation**: Helps maintain consistent code documentation and comments

The Copilot instructions are designed to help both new contributors and experienced developers work more effectively with this embedded codebase.
